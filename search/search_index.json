DMS experiments are not directed evolution in the conventional sense as they typically do not evolutionarily optimize a protein for a particular function through multiple rounds of selection. However, DMS experiments leverage many of the same approaches and yield useful insight into mutational landscapes for guiding subsequent directed evolution experiments. DMS experiments also generate large amounts of data that are highly useful for training machine learning models that can be used to guide directed evolution 2. DMS has been applied to several types of mutational lesions3 including codon mutations4\u20136 as well as mutations that alter protein topology, including domain insertion7,8, circular permutation9, and truncation10. DMS experiments commonly analyze comprehensive codon mutagenesis (CCM). CCM is the process of generating combinatorial libraries where the amino acid encoded at each residue location within a protein is randomized to all possible amino acids. CCM libraries can be generated using a variety of techniques. Nicking mutagenesis, codon tiling PCR11, inverse PCR12, transposon mutagenesis7\u20139 and recently CCM libraries have been generated from pools of synthetic oligos that can be generated in high-throughput using oligo library synthesis (OLS) approaches6,8. Here we present the basic protocols and tips for designing and constructing comprehensive codon mutagenesis libraries and considerations for enrichment and deep sequencing analysis. The principles of comprehensive codon mutagenesis The basic principle of comprehensive codon mutagenesis is to generate a large library of vectors for expressing protein variants with single point mutations. A sufficient number of vectors are generated such that the library contains a protein variant with a mutation at each of the possible residue positions. Library Construction There are a variety of approaches for generating comprehensive codon mutagenesis libraries that require different levels of resources. Below is a list with general descriptions of many protocols historically used to generate CCM libraries with links to primary literature and detailed protocols. To help decide which approach best fits your lab\u2019s resources each entry contains a summary of the method, challenges and limitations of the method, and examples where this method was used to generate CCM libraries. PFunkel 4 Summary: This is the original comprehensive codon mutagenesis approach. PFunkel was inspired by Kunkel site-directed mutagenesis that leverages uracil-containing, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) templates to limit the presence of wild-type vectors carried over in transformations13 as uracil-containing ssDNA is rapidly degraded in bacteria. PFunkel is a modification to this method that increases mutational efficiency from 50-90% that is achieved using the Kunkle method to nearly 100% using PFunkel. A uracil-containing ssDNA template is generating by propagating phagemid DNA containing the f1 phage origin and target gene in an Escherichia coli dut-1 ung-1 host and infecting the culture with the M13 helper phage and harvesting ssDNA from isolated phage particles. E. coli dut-1 ung-1 contains a heat-sensitive dUTPase and lacks uracil DNA glycosylase activity resulting in the production of uracil-containing DNA. Mutagenic oligonucleotide primers containing desired mutations are phosphorylated using T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (PNK) to enable subsequent ligation of DNA products using Taq ligase A mutated second strand is generated by mixing the phosphorylated oligonucleotide and the uracil-containing ssDNA template (4:1 molar ratio) along with PfuTurbo Cx DNA polymerase, Taq ligase, DTT, NAD+, and dNTPs. The mixture is then thermocycled to allow for denaturation, annealing, extension and ligation to generate a mutated second strand with a sealed nick. To generate a complementary mutated strand a second oligonucleotide primer that anneals outside of the mutated gene is then added to the reaction and the denaturation, annealing, extension and ligation cycle is repeated. To remove the uracil-containing ssDNA template uracil DNA glycosylase and exonuclease III are added to the reaction to generate nicks at the uracil containing bases and degrade the ssDNA template. DNA is then directly transformed into chemically competent cells or purified and electroporated into electrocompetent cells. Close to 100% efficiency for single codon mutations This method is highly extensible allowing for Multiple codon positions to be targeted simultaneously in a single vector by leveraging multiple mutagenic primers and the inability of PfuTurbo to strand-displace at low extension temperatures (<68C). Single-tube generation of comprehensive codon mutagenesis (CCM) libraries using pools of mutagenic oligos and using a low oligonucleotide primer to ssDNA template ratio (1:20) ensures only a single codon mutation in each vector. Enables ~96-97% of desired mutations to be sampled with no multiple mutations and minimal bias Challenges and limitations: Requires a specialized E. coli strain (E. coli dut-1 ung-1) not typically used in cloning workflows Requires specialized methods for isolating DNA from phage particles Modifications for isolating ssDNA using QIAGEN Miniprep Spin Kit can be found here Uracil-containing ssDNA yields can vary greatly between templates Requires a specialized DNA polymerase that can use uracil-containing templates (PfuTurbo Cx HotStart) Requires additional enzymes not commonly found in cloning workflows (uracil DNA glycosylase) Examples(s): CCM of \u03b2-lactamase (TEM-1) 4 CCM of a 40-codon region of the gene encoding levoglucosan kinase (LGK) from Lipomyces starkeyi 14 CCM of gene encoding an aliphatic amidase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (amiE)15 Inverse PCR 12 Summary: A template dsDNA plasmid is mutagenized by an inverse PCR reaction using adjacent, non-overlapping oligonucleotide primers that are complementary to opposite strands of the template and amplify the entire DNA vector. One of the oligonucleotide primers used in the PCR encodes \u2018NNK\u2019 (where N is A/C/G/T and K is G/T in equimolar ratio) at a single codon position within the protein and will randomize the encoded amino acid. The template is then phosphorylated and ligated to yield circular vectors that can be moved into cells for functional selection. This method is highly efficient, generating 90-95% of expected mutant vectors with ~5-10% of vectors containing deletions that are the result of primer synthesis errors. This method only requires materials commonly used in cloning workflows Challenges and limitations: PCR can introduce bias into the library due to bias in annealing primers with mismatches. This challenge can be alleviated by introducing the NNK mutation at the 5\u2019 end of one of the oligonucleotide primers. Each inverse PCR reaction is able to comprehensively mutate a single codon within a protein, requiring individual PCR reactions for each codon position in a protein to generate a comprehensive library. Large templates can be challenging to work with without introducing random mutations within the template backbone. Can be partially alleviated by using high-fidelity polymerases or by subcloning libraries into clean vector backbones. Example(s): CCM of tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT)16 Programmed allelic series (PALS) mutagenesis 6 Summary: Uses microarray-synthesized oligonucleotide pools that \u2018tile\u2019 the gene to introduce mutations using mutagenic primer extension. Used a uracil-containing template so that template DNA can be selectively degraded. Oligo pool is designed and commercially synthesized A series of 8 steps are needed to produce the full mutagenized library First library of mutagenic primers are amplified from the oligo pool using a set of adapter sequences and one adapter is removed using a uracil-containing base and USER enzyme. Second a uracil-containing ssDNA template of the sense strand is generated by amplifying the wild-type dsDNA template was PCR amplified using an unphosphorylated forward primer and a 5\u2019-phosphorylated reverse primer along with Kapa HiFi U+ HotStart Ready Mix supplemented with dUTPs to incorporate uracil bases. The antisense strand is degraded using lambda exonuclease. Third the mutagenic oligos are annealed and extended on the wildtype sense template Fourth the gene fragment is PCR amplified using an upstream primer and uracil containing oligo adapter that can be degraded along with the wildtype template using USER enzyme. Fifth a sense mutagenesis megaprimer is generated by annealing and extending an outer primer Sixth a uracil-containing ssDNA template of the antisense strand is generated by amplifying the wild-type dsDNA template was PCR amplified using a 5\u2019-phosphorylated forward primer and an unphosphorylated reverse primer along with Kapa HiFi U+ HotStart Ready Mix supplemented with dUTPs to incorporate uracil bases. The sense strand is degraded using lambda exonuclease. Seventh the mutagenesis megaprimers are annealed and extended on the uracil-containing wildtype antisense template Finally in the eighth step the WT template is degraded with USER and the the full length-mutant library is amplified using gene flanking primers This library is then subcloned into a suitable expression vector. For specific details see Supplementary Figure 1 from citation 6 Challenges and limitations: Requires specialized enzymes for generating the uracil containing DNA templates (Kapa HiFi U, USER enzyme #M5505) Oligo pools can be prohibitively expensive, but can be applied to many genes in tandem. Examples(s): CCM of a 64-codon region of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 gene and CCM of a 393-codon region of the human tumor suppressor p53 gene6 CCM of a 403-codon region of the catalytic site of a hyperthermophilic DNA polymerase from Thermococcus kodakarensis. Library was used for directed evolution to improve activity on synthesis of \u03b1-L-threofuranosyl nucleic acids (TNA) using a modified PALS approach17 Nicking mutagenesis 5 Summary: Overcomes the need for uracil-containing template DNA and some of the specialized enzymes (uracil DNA glycosylase) used by PFunkel and PALS. Selectively nicks double-stranded DNA template using a pair of strand-specific endonucleases (Nt.BbvCI and Nb.BbvCI) that nick wild type template DNA enabling exonucelase III degradation. To generate a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) template a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) template is treated with Nt.BbvC that selectively nicks a single strand at the BbvCI restriction site and is treated with exonuclease III and exonuclease I to degrade the nicked strand. Mutagenic oligonucleotide primers containing desired mutations are phosphorylated using T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (PNK) to enable subsequent ligation of DNA products using Taq ligase. A mutated second strand is generated by mixing the phosphorylated mutagenic oligonucleotide and the ssDNA template (1:20 molar ratio) along with Phusion DNA polymerase, Taq ligase, DTT, NAD+, and dNTPs. The mixture is then thermocycled to allow for denaturation, annealing, extension and ligation to generate a mutated second strand with a sealed nick. The wild-type ssDNA template is degraded by treating with Nb.BbvCI that selectively nicks the single strand at the BbvCI restriction site and is treated with exonuclease III and exonuclease I to degrade the nicked strand. A secondary oligonucleotide primer that complements the mutated strand is phosphorylated using T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (PNK) to enable subsequent ligation of DNA products using Taq ligase. A complementary second strand is generated by mixing the Nb.BbvCI treated mutated stand with the phosphorylated secondary oligonucleotide along with Phusion DNA polymerase, Taq ligase, DTT, NAD+, and dNTPs. The mixture is then thermocycled to allow for denaturation, annealing, extension and ligation to generate a mutated second strand with a sealed nick. DNA is purified and used is electroporated into electrocompetent cells. Similar extensibility as that of PFunkel allowing for single, multisite, or single-tube comprehensive codon mutagenesis. Modified to use microarray-synthesized oligo pools instead of individually synthesized oligos18,19 Challenges and limitations: Template plasmid must contain a 7-bp BbvCI restriction site to enable nicking strategy. Requires specialized restriction enzymes not commonly used in cloning workflows (Nt.BbvCI, Nb.BbvCI) Examples(s): CCM to two 71-codon regions of the gene encoding an aliphatic amidase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (amiE) and to an 81-codon region of \u03b2-lactamase (TEM-1) using individually synthesized oligos5 Detailed protocol can be found here CCM of the gene encoding an aliphatic amidase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (amiE), CCM of a 100-codon region of the anti-Influenza human antibody variable heavy gene UCA9, and targeted mutagenesis of the Arabidopsis thaliana gene encoding abscisic acid receptor PYR1 using microarray-synthesized oligo pools18 Detailed protocol can be found here CCM of the gene encoding the F capsid and the G spike protein from the bacteriophage \u03a6X174 using microarray-synthesized oligo pools19 Tiling primers for codon mutagenesis 11 Summary: This approach involves iterative rounds of low-cycle PCR with pools of mutagenic oligonucleotides that each contain \u2018NNN\u2019 triplet at a specific codon site. Oligos with a randomized \u2018NNN\u2019 nucleotide followed by upstream and downstream regions of the gene such that all primers have similar melting temperatures are generated using a python script Two oligo pools are generated one \u2018forward-fragement\u2019 set containing primers binding to the sense strand and one \u2018reverse-fragment\u2019 set containing primers that bind to the anti-sense strand. These can be commercially ordered as individual primer and then mixed into equimolar pools or can be ordered as oligo pools from a commercial source. Two end primers are designed to anneal to the termini of the gene sequence containing BsmBI restriction sites for cloning the library into an expression vector. The entire gene is amplified using the end primers in a 25 thermocycle reaction and agarose gel purified. Two fragment PCR reactions are run for using the purified template. 1) A \u2018forward-fragment\u2019 reaction containing the forward mutagenesis primer pool as well as the forward end primer and 2) a \u2018reverse-fragment\u2019 reaction containing the reverse mutagenesis primer pool and the reverse end primer. These PCRs are performed for only 7 thermocycles. These PCR products are then diluted 1:4 and used for a \u2018joining PCR reaction\u2019 using the two end primers to amplify full length mutant genes. This reaction is performed for 20 thermocycles. This joining PCR reaction is repeated up to three times, the number of times this process is repeated will control the number of multiple mutations observed within the gene (see the primer design software README for details). The product of this reaction is purified and cloned into the expression vector using BsmBI. This vector pool is then electroporated into ultracompetent cells. Challenges and limitations: This method generates proteins with a Poisson distribution of codon mutations. Some will have a single mutation while some will contain zero or multiple mutations. If the mean mutation per protein is 1 then 37% of the proteins will contain zero mutations, 37% will have one mutation, and the rest will have multiple mutations. Determining the number of cycles for this process to obtain libraries with desired levels of mutations can require some fine tuning. Examples(s): CCM of the influenza nucleoprotein11 CCM of the HIV envelope protein20 CCM of the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein21 Plasmid recombineering22 Summary: An in vivo mutagenesis approach that is amenable to directed evolution work flows. Relies on single-strand recombineering to generate mutations. An extensive review on recombineering and MAGE can be found here 23. Mutagenic oligonucleotides are designed to be complementary to the lagging strand of the gene of interest and contain a centrally located \u2018NNN\u2019 sequence. Oligonucleotides are then electroporated into the recombineering ready strain containing the WT plasmid. Plasmids can then be isolated from the strain or directly enriched for functionality using a selection or screen. After one round of plasmid recombineering ~29% of reads contained single amino acid mutations with nearly complete coverage of the possible residue mutations. 61% of the sequences corresponded to wild type sequences. Additional rounds of plasmid recombineering can be used to increase the penetrance of mutations and to generate variants with more than one mutation. Can also be targeted to specific regions. Challenges and limitations: Requires a recombineering and MAGE ready strain (for example: EcNR2 [Escherichia coli MG1655 mutS::cat (ybhBbioAB)::[cI857 N(cro-ea59)::tetR-bla]]). Yields libraries that contain positional and mismatch bias that are caused by the mechanism of recombineering relying on oligonucleotides annealing to the locus via homology resulting in nonuniform representation of each mutant. Examples(s): CCM of iLOV a 110-residue domain of the light, oxygen, voltage (LOV) domains of the A. thaliana phototropin 2 protein22 Library Oligo Design and Synthesis Considerations CCM libraries require the in silico design of oligos used for constructing the library of protein expression vectors. There are several available tools that facilitate library design. Useful software tools for the design of oligo libraries.

However, DMS experiments leverage many of the same approaches and yield useful insight into mutational landscapes for guiding subsequent directed evolution experiments. DMS experiments also generate large amounts of data that are highly useful for training machine learning models that can be used to guide directed evolution 2. DMS has been applied to several types of mutational lesions3 including codon mutations4\u20136 as well as mutations that alter protein topology, including domain insertion7,8, circular permutation9, and truncation10. DMS experiments commonly analyze comprehensive codon mutagenesis (CCM). CCM is the process of generating combinatorial libraries where the amino acid encoded at each residue location within a protein is randomized to all possible amino acids. CCM libraries can be generated using a variety of techniques. Nicking mutagenesis, codon tiling PCR11, inverse PCR12, transposon mutagenesis7\u20139 and recently CCM libraries have been generated from pools of synthetic oligos that can be generated in high-throughput using oligo library synthesis (OLS) approaches6,8.

Below is a list with general descriptions of many protocols historically used to generate CCM libraries with links to primary literature and detailed protocols. To help decide which approach best fits your lab\u2019s resources each entry contains a summary of the method, challenges and limitations of the method, and examples where this method was used to generate CCM libraries. PFunkel 4 Summary: This is the original comprehensive codon mutagenesis approach. PFunkel was inspired by Kunkel site-directed mutagenesis that leverages uracil-containing, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) templates to limit the presence of wild-type vectors carried over in transformations13 as uracil-containing ssDNA is rapidly degraded in bacteria. PFunkel is a modification to this method that increases mutational efficiency from 50-90% that is achieved using the Kunkle method to nearly 100% using PFunkel. A uracil-containing ssDNA template is generating by propagating phagemid DNA containing the f1 phage origin and target gene in an Escherichia coli dut-1 ung-1 host and infecting the culture with the M13 helper phage and harvesting ssDNA from isolated phage particles. E. coli dut-1 ung-1 contains a heat-sensitive dUTPase and lacks uracil DNA glycosylase activity resulting in the production of uracil-containing DNA. Mutagenic oligonucleotide primers containing desired mutations are phosphorylated using T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (PNK) to enable subsequent ligation of DNA products using Taq ligase A mutated second strand is generated by mixing the phosphorylated oligonucleotide and the uracil-containing ssDNA template (4:1 molar ratio) along with PfuTurbo Cx DNA polymerase, Taq ligase, DTT, NAD+, and dNTPs. The mixture is then thermocycled to allow for denaturation, annealing, extension and ligation to generate a mutated second strand with a sealed nick. To generate a complementary mutated strand a second oligonucleotide primer that anneals outside of the mutated gene is then added to the reaction and the denaturation, annealing, extension and ligation cycle is repeated. To remove the uracil-containing ssDNA template uracil DNA glycosylase and exonuclease III are added to the reaction to generate nicks at the uracil containing bases and degrade the ssDNA template. DNA is then directly transformed into chemically competent cells or purified and electroporated into electrocompetent cells. Close to 100% efficiency for single codon mutations This method is highly extensible allowing for Multiple codon positions to be targeted simultaneously in a single vector by leveraging multiple mutagenic primers and the inability of PfuTurbo to strand-displace at low extension temperatures (<68C). Single-tube generation of comprehensive codon mutagenesis (CCM) libraries using pools of mutagenic oligos and using a low oligonucleotide primer to ssDNA template ratio (1:20) ensures only a single codon mutation in each vector. Enables ~96-97% of desired mutations to be sampled with no multiple mutations and minimal bias Challenges and limitations: Requires a specialized E. coli strain (E. coli dut-1 ung-1) not typically used in cloning workflows Requires specialized methods for isolating DNA from phage particles Modifications for isolating ssDNA using QIAGEN Miniprep Spin Kit can be found here Uracil-containing ssDNA yields can vary greatly between templates Requires a specialized DNA polymerase that can use uracil-containing templates (PfuTurbo Cx HotStart) Requires additional enzymes not commonly found in cloning workflows (uracil DNA glycosylase) Examples(s): CCM of \u03b2-lactamase (TEM-1) 4 CCM of a 40-codon region of the gene encoding levoglucosan kinase (LGK) from Lipomyces starkeyi 14 CCM of gene encoding an aliphatic amidase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (amiE)15 Inverse PCR 12 Summary: A template dsDNA plasmid is mutagenized by an inverse PCR reaction using adjacent, non-overlapping oligonucleotide primers that are complementary to opposite strands of the template and amplify the entire DNA vector. One of the oligonucleotide primers used in the PCR encodes \u2018NNK\u2019 (where N is A/C/G/T and K is G/T in equimolar ratio) at a single codon position within the protein and will randomize the encoded amino acid. The template is then phosphorylated and ligated to yield circular vectors that can be moved into cells for functional selection. This method is highly efficient, generating 90-95% of expected mutant vectors with ~5-10% of vectors containing deletions that are the result of primer synthesis errors. This method only requires materials commonly used in cloning workflows Challenges and limitations: PCR can introduce bias into the library due to bias in annealing primers with mismatches. This challenge can be alleviated by introducing the NNK mutation at the 5\u2019 end of one of the oligonucleotide primers. Each inverse PCR reaction is able to comprehensively mutate a single codon within a protein, requiring individual PCR reactions for each codon position in a protein to generate a comprehensive library. Large templates can be challenging to work with without introducing random mutations within the template backbone. Can be partially alleviated by using high-fidelity polymerases or by subcloning libraries into clean vector backbones. Example(s): CCM of tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT)16 Programmed allelic series (PALS) mutagenesis 6 Summary: Uses microarray-synthesized oligonucleotide pools that \u2018tile\u2019 the gene to introduce mutations using mutagenic primer extension. Used a uracil-containing template so that template DNA can be selectively degraded. Oligo pool is designed and commercially synthesized A series of 8 steps are needed to produce the full mutagenized library First library of mutagenic primers are amplified from the oligo pool using a set of adapter sequences and one adapter is removed using a uracil-containing base and USER enzyme. Second a uracil-containing ssDNA template of the sense strand is generated by amplifying the wild-type dsDNA template was PCR amplified using an unphosphorylated forward primer and a 5\u2019-phosphorylated reverse primer along with Kapa HiFi U+ HotStart Ready Mix supplemented with dUTPs to incorporate uracil bases. The antisense strand is degraded using lambda exonuclease. Third the mutagenic oligos are annealed and extended on the wildtype sense template Fourth the gene fragment is PCR amplified using an upstream primer and uracil containing oligo adapter that can be degraded along with the wildtype template using USER enzyme. Fifth a sense mutagenesis megaprimer is generated by annealing and extending an outer primer Sixth a uracil-containing ssDNA template of the antisense strand is generated by amplifying the wild-type dsDNA template was PCR amplified using a 5\u2019-phosphorylated forward primer and an unphosphorylated reverse primer along with Kapa HiFi U+ HotStart Ready Mix supplemented with dUTPs to incorporate uracil bases. The sense strand is degraded using lambda exonuclease. Seventh the mutagenesis megaprimers are annealed and extended on the uracil-containing wildtype antisense template Finally in the eighth step the WT template is degraded with USER and the the full length-mutant library is amplified using gene flanking primers This library is then subcloned into a suitable expression vector. For specific details see Supplementary Figure 1 from citation 6 Challenges and limitations: Requires specialized enzymes for generating the uracil containing DNA templates (Kapa HiFi U, USER enzyme #M5505) Oligo pools can be prohibitively expensive, but can be applied to many genes in tandem. Examples(s): CCM of a 64-codon region of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 gene and CCM of a 393-codon region of the human tumor suppressor p53 gene6 CCM of a 403-codon region of the catalytic site of a hyperthermophilic DNA polymerase from Thermococcus kodakarensis. Library was used for directed evolution to improve activity on synthesis of \u03b1-L-threofuranosyl nucleic acids (TNA) using a modified PALS approach17 Nicking mutagenesis 5 Summary: Overcomes the need for uracil-containing template DNA and some of the specialized enzymes (uracil DNA glycosylase) used by PFunkel and PALS. Selectively nicks double-stranded DNA template using a pair of strand-specific endonucleases (Nt.BbvCI and Nb.BbvCI) that nick wild type template DNA enabling exonucelase III degradation. To generate a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) template a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) template is treated with Nt.BbvC that selectively nicks a single strand at the BbvCI restriction site and is treated with exonuclease III and exonuclease I to degrade the nicked strand. Mutagenic oligonucleotide primers containing desired mutations are phosphorylated using T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (PNK) to enable subsequent ligation of DNA products using Taq ligase. A mutated second strand is generated by mixing the phosphorylated mutagenic oligonucleotide and the ssDNA template (1:20 molar ratio) along with Phusion DNA polymerase, Taq ligase, DTT, NAD+, and dNTPs. The mixture is then thermocycled to allow for denaturation, annealing, extension and ligation to generate a mutated second strand with a sealed nick. The wild-type ssDNA template is degraded by treating with Nb.BbvCI that selectively nicks the single strand at the BbvCI restriction site and is treated with exonuclease III and exonuclease I to degrade the nicked strand. A secondary oligonucleotide primer that complements the mutated strand is phosphorylated using T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (PNK) to enable subsequent ligation of DNA products using Taq ligase. A complementary second strand is generated by mixing the Nb.BbvCI treated mutated stand with the phosphorylated secondary oligonucleotide along with Phusion DNA polymerase, Taq ligase, DTT, NAD+, and dNTPs. The mixture is then thermocycled to allow for denaturation, annealing, extension and ligation to generate a mutated second strand with a sealed nick. DNA is purified and used is electroporated into electrocompetent cells. Similar extensibility as that of PFunkel allowing for single, multisite, or single-tube comprehensive codon mutagenesis. Modified to use microarray-synthesized oligo pools instead of individually synthesized oligos18,19 Challenges and limitations: Template plasmid must contain a 7-bp BbvCI restriction site to enable nicking strategy. Requires specialized restriction enzymes not commonly used in cloning workflows (Nt.BbvCI, Nb.BbvCI) Examples(s): CCM to two 71-codon regions of the gene encoding an aliphatic amidase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (amiE) and to an 81-codon region of \u03b2-lactamase (TEM-1) using individually synthesized oligos5 Detailed protocol can be found here CCM of the gene encoding an aliphatic amidase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (amiE), CCM of a 100-codon region of the anti-Influenza human antibody variable heavy gene UCA9, and targeted mutagenesis of the Arabidopsis thaliana gene encoding abscisic acid receptor PYR1 using microarray-synthesized oligo pools18 Detailed protocol can be found here CCM of the gene encoding the F capsid and the G spike protein from the bacteriophage \u03a6X174 using microarray-synthesized oligo pools19 Tiling primers for codon mutagenesis 11 Summary: This approach involves iterative rounds of low-cycle PCR with pools of mutagenic oligonucleotides that each contain \u2018NNN\u2019 triplet at a specific codon site. Oligos with a randomized \u2018NNN\u2019 nucleotide followed by upstream and downstream regions of the gene such that all primers have similar melting temperatures are generated using a python script Two oligo pools are generated one \u2018forward-fragement\u2019 set containing primers binding to the sense strand and one \u2018reverse-fragment\u2019 set containing primers that bind to the anti-sense strand. These can be commercially ordered as individual primer and then mixed into equimolar pools or can be ordered as oligo pools from a commercial source. Two end primers are designed to anneal to the termini of the gene sequence containing BsmBI restriction sites for cloning the library into an expression vector. The entire gene is amplified using the end primers in a 25 thermocycle reaction and agarose gel purified. Two fragment PCR reactions are run for using the purified template. 1) A \u2018forward-fragment\u2019 reaction containing the forward mutagenesis primer pool as well as the forward end primer and 2) a \u2018reverse-fragment\u2019 reaction containing the reverse mutagenesis primer pool and the reverse end primer. These PCRs are performed for only 7 thermocycles. These PCR products are then diluted 1:4 and used for a \u2018joining PCR reaction\u2019 using the two end primers to amplify full length mutant genes. This reaction is performed for 20 thermocycles. This joining PCR reaction is repeated up to three times, the number of times this process is repeated will control the number of multiple mutations observed within the gene (see the primer design software README for details). The product of this reaction is purified and cloned into the expression vector using BsmBI. This vector pool is then electroporated into ultracompetent cells. Challenges and limitations: This method generates proteins with a Poisson distribution of codon mutations. Some will have a single mutation while some will contain zero or multiple mutations. If the mean mutation per protein is 1 then 37% of the proteins will contain zero mutations, 37% will have one mutation, and the rest will have multiple mutations. Determining the number of cycles for this process to obtain libraries with desired levels of mutations can require some fine tuning. Examples(s): CCM of the influenza nucleoprotein11 CCM of the HIV envelope protein20 CCM of the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein21 Plasmid recombineering22 Summary: An in vivo mutagenesis approach that is amenable to directed evolution work flows. Relies on single-strand recombineering to generate mutations. An extensive review on recombineering and MAGE can be found here 23. Mutagenic oligonucleotides are designed to be complementary to the lagging strand of the gene of interest and contain a centrally located \u2018NNN\u2019 sequence. Oligonucleotides are then electroporated into the recombineering ready strain containing the WT plasmid. Plasmids can then be isolated from the strain or directly enriched for functionality using a selection or screen. After one round of plasmid recombineering ~29% of reads contained single amino acid mutations with nearly complete coverage of the possible residue mutations. 61% of the sequences corresponded to wild type sequences. Additional rounds of plasmid recombineering can be used to increase the penetrance of mutations and to generate variants with more than one mutation. Can also be targeted to specific regions. Challenges and limitations: Requires a recombineering and MAGE ready strain (for example: EcNR2 [Escherichia coli MG1655 mutS::cat (ybhBbioAB)::[cI857 N(cro-ea59)::tetR-bla]]). Yields libraries that contain positional and mismatch bias that are caused by the mechanism of recombineering relying on oligonucleotides annealing to the locus via homology resulting in nonuniform representation of each mutant. Examples(s): CCM of iLOV a 110-residue domain of the light, oxygen, voltage (LOV) domains of the A. thaliana phototropin 2 protein22 Library Oligo Design and Synthesis Considerations CCM libraries require the in silico design of oligos used for constructing the library of protein expression vectors.

The first report of this method dates back to 1996 (https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0798-652). Since then, a wide variety of IVC protocols has been developed (see below). Correct mixing of oil, detergents, reaction components, and DNA ensures that each droplet contains only a single copy of the genotype or none at all. The maximum number of mutants that can be reliably screened with IVC rarely exceeds 109. Otherwise, the IVC method is far superior to other in vitro selection protocols. It allows the selection of binders and enzymes since the product of their activity is also trapped in the vesicle. Principle and Examples Different versions of covalent DNA display, where each expressed protein gets physically connected to its encoding DNA, are also examples of IVC here and[here]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17948318/). A powerful method that follows the notion of entrapping genotype and phenotype in the same droplet was used in Compartmentalised Self-Replication (CSR, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30040233/). In this protocol, cells expressing mutant DNA polymerases get entrapped in droplets, along with primers for amplification of the gene encoding the DNA polymerase, nucleotides, and reaction buffer. Following lysis of the cell, both DNA polymerase mutant and the encoding plasmid are released. The DNA of the most active DNA polymerase variants gets exponentially amplified in the emulsion to be used in further rounds of CSR.

A version of this protocol suitable for selecting reverse transcriptases of both natural and xenonucleic acids (Compartmentalized Bead Labelling or CBL ) demonstrates the huge potential that IVS has over other in vitro selection methods. Challenges Different versions of IVC have their inherent limits that are not addressed here. Challenges in setting up a version of IVC that contain in vitro transcription-translation systems often come from two sources: Vesicle formation is a difficult procedure that includes the use of detergent and high-frequency mixing. Both factors can irreversibly damage translation components. Thus, known protocols should be followed with great attention to the details. Expect lots of optimisation initially. A degree in polydispersity among droplets is another challenge, as it leads to variation in the reaction rates due to the dilution effect. Microfluidic setups can be used for the preparation of monodisperse droplets. However, these setups have orders of magnitude lower levels of throughput. Future directions As can be appreciated from the number of exciting developments of IVC, this method has tremendous potential for further development. As it is ideally suited for the selection of enzymatic activities, lots of studies are expected in this direction, especially in the field of nucleic acid enzymes. In principle, it can be used in the selection of systems containing several molecular components, the combined activity of which leads to the production of a marker for a readout. Entrapping activity components in droplets have a lot in common with artificial cells.

While FACS cytometers can analyze and sort both cells and droplets (with or without cells), they cannot generate the latter. FADS cytometers, on the other hand, can generate droplets that will encapsulate cell-free mixtures or cells for subsequent analysis and sorting. Despite their differences, both systems are used for high-throughput screening of particles and we will mostly focus on FACS applications as they are more common/accessible among laboratories. FACS cytometers are complex instruments that can analyze the fluorescent characteristics of individual \u201cparticles\u201d (e.g., cells, liposomes, beads, emulsion droplets, or polymer shells) at extremely high event rates (~10^7 per hour), isolating those with the desired signal for the desired trait Challenges The main bottleneck in the usage of these systems is that they require the linkage of a genotype (a nucleic acid sequence) to a phenotype (a functional feature like binding or catalytic activity) in an ultrahigh-throughput context (Griffiths and Tawfik, 2006). In other words, the activity of an evolved molecule must be somehow linked to an output that is detectable by the FACS machine (usually a fluorescence signal). Once detected, the particle is sorted and its content can then be sequenced for establishing the genotype-phenotype relationship. Creating experimental setups for these types of studies can be very difficult depending on the system one is working with. If you work with the directed evolution of fluorescent proteins, the signal is directly provided by your protein, however, if you work with metabolic enzymes, for example, you might have to use indirect methods, such as fluorogenic substrates (if available), transcription factors that detect the product of your reaction, being induced by it, and activate the expression of a fluorescent protein, etc. Thus, for screenings involving indirect relationships, things can get a way more complicated. We will see below many examples addressing these challenges and, hopefully, they will serve as inspiration for your project! Firstly, we will briefly explore different FACS-based screening tech\u00adniques in directed evolution. They can be divided into six distinct categories according to the methods used to link the genotype and phenotype: - cell surface display (or in vivo display) of enzymes, - fluorescent protein-based methods, - entrapment of the product inside the cells, - in vitro compartmentalization, - single-cell/microcolony compartmentalization Cell surface display This technique is based on the attachment of heterologous enzymes to the surface of microorganisms (the most common are: bacterial surface display (van Bloois et al., 2011)), yeast (yeast surface display (Boder and Wittrup, 1997)) or phages (phage surface display (Fernandez-Gacio et al., 2003)). Cell display offers ultra\u00adhigh-throughput capacity of up to 10^9 clones per round and allows direct contact between the enzyme and the added substrate, without requiring dif\u00adfusion through the cell membrane. However, this accessibility is at the same time a major drawback as the product is also freely diffusible. This drawback has been overcome by the development of cell microencapsulation techniques that imitate natural cell compartmentalization e.g., including the target enzyme in microemulsion droplets along with the substrate and products (Griffiths and Tawfik, 2006). The main advantages of the cell-in-droplet approach are its high-throughput capacity (~10^9 clones per round) and the reduced volume of the microemulsions (typically ~5 femtoliters), such that little substrate is needed (Aharoni et al., 2005). Very recently, novel screening platforms using polymer encapsulated cells have been developed like: (1) the cellular high-throughput encapsulation, solubilization and screening (CHESS) method to allow the encapsulation of libraries of approximately 10^8 mutants in a polymer to form cell-like microcapsules (Yong and Scott, 2015), (2) the polymer shell method that relies on fluorescent hydrogel formation around E. coli cells (Pitzler et al., 2014) or yeast cells (Vanella et al,. 2019). In vitro display This method is based on the synthesis of the target protein through an in vitro translation system so that the genotype-phenotype linkage is achieved using molecules like ribosomes (ribosome display), puromycin (mRNA display), and the DNA replication initiator pro\u00adtein RepA (CIS display). More recently, novel in vitro display approaches have been reported that include liposome and megavalent bead display. Liposome display enables membrane proteins to be engineered, and it relies on their display on liposome membranes through the transcription and trans\u00adlation of a single DNA molecule using an encapsulated cell-free transla\u00adtion system (Fujii et al., 2014). Megavalent bead surface display allows tailor-made protein binders by laboratory evolution. In this method, the gene that encodes the protein of interest is attached to a bead by strong noncova\u00adlent interactions and the corresponding protein is displayed via a covalent thioether bond on the DNA (Diamante et al., 2013). Fluorescent protein-based methods Due to their fluorescent properties, GFP and other fluorescent proteins (FPs) variants are ideal candidates for single-cell fluores\u00adcence analysis (you can find more about them in this amazingly resourceful website: https://www.fpbase.org/) and, therefore, they can be used in flow cytometry screening (Yang and Withers, 2009). The main advantages of GFP-based screening methods are their very high-throughput (\u223c10 7\u201310 8 clones per round) and the lack of expensive fluorescent substrates. On the other hand, the biggest challenge in this approach is to link the enzymatic func\u00adtion or activity of interest to the FPs expression, which can be very difficult depending on the studied protein. While the results achieved using this flow cytometry-based screen are promising, we must emphasize that flow cytometry is unlikely to serve as a standalone method. It is well-known that individual cells from bacterial cultures composed of a single genotype may display a range of phenotypes attributable to the stochastic nature of gene expression. As one considers that the selection criteria in flow cytometry experiments are determined by the phenotype of an individual cell, the inherent population heterogeneity of a bacterial culture, especially one containing a library of genotypes, makes the task of counter-selecting for one phenotype against another extremely challenging. For example, isolating a single bacterium displaying a low level of fluorescence does not guarantee that a culture grown from that single bacterium will possess, as a whole, those same fluorescence characteristics. With this in mind, the need for reinforcing a single-cell enrichment strategy with traditional assays, measuring average expression levels for an entire population, should be clear. As FP-based methods are becoming more and more common, a few examples for the directed evolution of different molecules can be found below: - Transcription factor directed evolution (usually targeted to ligand and/or DNA binding domains) Tang and colleagues evolved a XylR regulator towards improved operating range, producing a more linear response of the system to the xylose inducer. In other words, a system which was originally considered a bistable molecular switch (digital) was evolved into an analogic one. In this example, the link between genotype and protein function was established by a transcriptional interaction: XylR directly regulated the expression of a GFP gene and mutations affecting the function of the regulator could be readily tracked by the analysis and selection of cells with fluorescence levels that were different from the original system. https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00225 In a different approach, Machado and colleagues evolved a repressor called PcaV to act as a biosensor for hydroxyl-substituted benzoic acids (such as vanillin and other closely related aromatic aldehydes). The overall system was similar to the one discussed above, linking protein function to fluorescent output through a transcriptional system directly repressed by PcaV which was alleviated by the usage of inducing molecules. After the generation of PcaV mutants, cells were screened through multiple rounds of counter-selection using FACS. In the first round, libraries were uninduced and selected for low fluorescence levels in order to remove non-functional repressors (cells expressing GFP without the inducer probably had non-functional repressors). On the second round, the previously sorted libraries were induced with the new molecule e.g. vanillin (that did not induce the original PcaV) and selected for GFP expression (functional mutants responding to vanillin). On the third round, the uninduced library was selected for cells with low fluorescence levels (this time with a less stringent cutoff than the first round). Finally, cells were again induced with the new molecule and selected for the most fluorescent cells. With this approach, a new biosensor capable of detecting vanillin and other related molecules was generated. https://jbioleng.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13036-019-0214-z In our last example, a good combination of dry and wetlab was employed. The IPTG responsive Transcription Factor LacI has been computationally redesigned and mutated to recognize four new non-native inducers (Taylor et al., 2016). This study is a good example of how the combination of computation-guided mutagenesis based on the Rosetta algorithm and different diversification techniques (such as epPCR and saturation mutagenesis) can accelerate the discovery/generation of new molecular functions. In a counter-selection round, the mutant libraries were pre-screened for retained ability to repress a TolC reporter (a porin that allows entry of toxic colicin E1) by growth enrichment in the absence of inducers but in the presence of colicin E1. The enriched LacI libraries were then positively screened by FACS for their ability to activate production of GFP upon induction with different sugars, resulting in variants of LacI that were responsive to fucose, gentiobiose, lactitol and sucralose (Taylor et al., 2016). In this instance, no active counter-screening was performed against activation by IPTG, so nearly all mutants retained their ability to respond to IPTG, a phenotype that was reduced for some designs upon shuffling of mutations for activity screening. https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/1/e3/5645005?login=true - Evolution of promoters/cis-regulatory regions For the study and directed evolution of promoter and cis-regulatory regions, a recent and extremely powerful strategy is the Sort-Seq. It relies on the power of FACS for sorting individual cells from libraries of regulatory sequences (controlling the expression of a FP) into different bins, according to their fluorescence levels. Later, each bin is sequenced through and the pool of regulatory sequences in each bin is analysed for the understanding, prediction and re-engineering of sequence-function (promoter-expression) relationships, https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-016-2533-5 https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-genom-083118-014845 Although not exactly a directed evolution project, the work from de Boer and colleagues (de Boer et al., 2019) provides an insightful resource for the generation and study of promoter libraries in yeast. Through the usage of random mutagenesis, a library of 100,000,000 promoters was cloned upstream of a Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) gene and screened through FACS for different promoter activities (cells were binned according to their YFP expression levels). Each bin was then sequenced and a machine learning interpretable model was built with this data, allowing accurate prediction of the library and of independent test promoters that were designed de novo following the model rules. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0315-8 In a similar approach using E. coli cells, Urtecho and colleagues (Urtecho et al., 2019) explored the combinatorial space of sigma70 promoter elements in E. coli a combinatorial library of promoter elements was generated, cloned upstream a GFP reporter gene, sorted into bins by FACS and sequenced (both DNA and RNA-seq) for establishing the genotype (promoter sequence)-phenotype(GFP expression bins) relationships. One could use this strategy to evolve not only constitutive promoters but also inducible promoters (see see Rohlihil et al., 2017 for the Engineering a Formaldehyde-Inducible Promoter and Yu et al., 2021 for the engineering of LacI based systems) towards different expression dynamics. https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.biochem.7b01069 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20094-3 https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00114 Directed evolution of enzymes by linking the product to a biosensor Although linking enzyme mutant libraries to FPs for FACS-based directed evolution is not a straightforward task, many groups have achieved it through the adoption of in vivo Biosensors. These biosensors can be any molecular sensor (usually protein or RNA-based one) that will interact with the product of a specific reaction and modulate the expression of a FP according to the product concentration. The biggest challenge is to find/engingineer sensors that can detect specific metabolites (in the native cellular concentrations) and also possess a good dynamic range for reliably connecting the input (product concentration) to the output (FP production). A comprehensive review in this topic has been written by Lin and colleagues and will probably give you some inspiring ideas if you decide to work on this topic. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0734975017300812 As an example of using a transcription factor to link the activity of an enzyme to the expression of a FP, let's consider the work of Kwon and collaborators (Kwon et al., 2018). In this study, the main goal was to change the substrate scope of a tryptophan-indole lyase from tryptophan-indole to tyrosine-phenol. The expression of the FP in E. coli cells was controlled by a phenol-inducible transcription factor (DmpR). Using this genetic circuit-based biosensor for detection of phenolic components, the substrate scope of a tryptophan-indole lyase was re-engineered by directed evolution towards the desired tyrosine-phenol-lyase with complete loss of the original activity. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20943-8 RNA sensors have also been used to screen enzymes from directed evolution with improved activities. For example, Michener and Smolke (Michener and Smolke, 2012) have targeted yCDM1, an enzyme that is not very efficient in demethylating caffeine to theophylline. A RNA riboswitch was used as a theophylline biosensor. The RNA switch was placed in the 3\u2032 UTR region of a fluorescent reporter gene. If no theophylline was available, the poly-A tail of the mRNA was removed, leading to rapid degradation and low gene expression. Addition of the small molecule ligand favored a conformation in which the mRNA was stable and translation could proceed. Thus, the enzyme was mutagenized through EP-PCR and the RNA-based biosensor was used for screening with FACS. A mutant version of yCDM1 was obtained showing 33-fold increase in enzyme activity and 22-fold increase in selectivity. (Michener and Smolke, 2012). https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S109671761200047X?via%3Dihub Directed evolution of RNA/DNA aptamers/switches If a biosensor for your system is not available, why not try to develop one through directed evolution? This strategy, although very laborious, has been adopted by many groups with a special focus on RNA-based sensors. The first class of RNA-based sensors we will see are Riboswitches. They are biosensors typically composed of an aptamer domain, which recognizes a specific ligand, and an expression platform that couples ligand binding to a change in the FP expression. A traditional example of riboswitch directed evolution was demonstrated by Sean and Gallivan (Sean & Gallivan, 2009). Libraries (theophylline aptamer, followed by a sequence of eight randomized bases, the RBS, and the red-fluorescent reporter gene DsRed) were generated through random primers and cloned into plasmids for in vivo expression in E. coli. The system was coupled to a FP in a way that FP expression was increased in the presence of theophylline through the exposure of the RBS region, which was previously \u201cmasked\u201d by the mRNA secondary structure. A more recent study by Page and colleagues (Page et al., 2018) using the same system has also generated novel theophylline riboswitches by coupling a dual genetic selection and FACS. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2615613/ https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00099 The second class of RNA-based sensors are toehold switches, A toehold switch is an RNA fragment with a secondary hairpin structure that is used to regulate translation. The toehold sequence contains a strong ribosome binding site (RBS) and a start codon that is followed by the coding sequence of a reporter gene. In the absence of a complementary sequence, the toehold is in its native hairpin conformation acting as a translational repressor and preventing ribosomes from binding to the RBS and thus from translating the reporter gene downstream. In the presence of a single stranded trigger complementary to the stem of the hairpin, the switch unfolds and exposes the ribosome binding site and the start codon and translation can be initiated. In a very comprehensive study, Green and colleagues (Green et al., 2014) have designed and characterized libraries of Toehold Switches, ending up with 26 sensors that could be used together with very little crosstalk and high dynamic range for the detection of endogenous mRNA in E. coli and the building of genetic circuits. The researchers used the NUPACK nucleic acid sequence design package (Zadeh et al., 2011) to generate libraries of de-novo-designed translational activators satisfying their desired parameters followed by synthesis of the oligos, cloning and in vivo testing of the libraries through FACS. In a more recent study,Angenent-Mari and colleagues ( Angenent-Mari et al., 2020) have taken one step further, using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to predict toehold switch function as a canonical riboswitch model in synthetic biology. To facilitate DNN training, they synthesized and characterized in vivo a dataset of 91,534 toehold switches spanning 23 viral genomes and 906 human transcription factors. DNNs trained on nucleotide sequences outperformed previous state-of-the-art thermodynamic and kinetic models. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867414012896 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18677-1 Entrapment of the substrate/product inside the cells An alternative to cell surface dis\u00adplay strategies and FP-based screening methods are approaches in which the fluorescent product is trapped within the cell (Yang and Withers, 2009). This strategy faces two main challenges: (i) the obtention of commercial fluorogenic substrates for that specific reaction and (ii) the retention of such molecules inside of the cell. In this context, before starting a project based on this approach, one has to check for the availability of commercial fluorogenic substrates that cannot diffuse to the extracellular environment. The entrapment is usually achieved when the size, polarity, or other chemical proper\u00adties of the substrate are modified, resulting in the retention of the product within the cell. As a successful example, Tan and colleagues (Tan et al., 2019) have improved the fucosylation catalytic efficiency of an \u03b11,3-FucT fucosidase by 14-fold after three rounds of directed evolution in E. coli. Two kinds of fluorescently labeled acceptor substrates (LacNAc derivatives) were designed and synthesized for cell entrapment. They were transported into the cell via the LacY transporter. The fucosylation reaction resulted in a trisaccharide product that accumulated inside of the cell as the LacY transport rate for such products was very low. Thus, fluorescence intensities of cells carried the information about the fucosylation efficiency allowing FACS-based screenings. Another possibility is to work with fluorogenic probes inside the cell that detect the substrate/product of the reaction. Sadler and colleagues (Sadler et al., 2018) have engineered a monoamine oxidase with improved activity towards a novel secondary amine substrate amine substrates based on the intracellular oxidation of a fluorogenic substrate by intracellular bacterial peroxidases. The authors expressed the amine oxidase variant library in E. coli and stained cells with a fluorogenic probe which is sensitive to oxidation by H2O2 (a byproduct of the monoamine oxidase reaction). The probe was introduced into cells with the help of freeze-thaw cycles and chemicals that increased membrane permeability. Finally, the drawback of substrate/product entrapment in the cell can also be overcome by the adoption of cell microencapsulation techniques that imitate natural cell compartmentalization as previously discussed in the Cell surface display section. As an example, a microdroplet-enabled FACS based screening strategy was also developed for improving cellulase activity. In this study, Ostafe et al. used double emulsions to encapsulate yeast cells expressing cellulase in microfluidic droplets (Ostafe et al., 2013). Glucose that was released by cellulose activity on carboxymethylcellulose substrate was detected via a hexose oxidase based coupled enzyme assay and enrichment of a positive population was demonstrated based on droplet fluorescence. https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/10/eaaw8451 https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/AN/C8AN00851E#!divAbstract In vitro compartmentalization (IVC) Microencapsulation can be performed in the absence of cells, directly producing the enzyme from the DNA library by in vitro protein translation. Such IVC offers the advantage of generating a large number of droplets per emulsion volume unit (>1010 in 1 mL of emul\u00adsion), coupled to the ease of preparing emulsions and their high stability to changes in temperature, pH, and salt concentrations (Aharoni et al., 2005). Additionally, IVC prevents the gene diversity loss derived from the cloning and transformation steps by in vitro protein translation of the DNA used to generate the mutant library; moreover, it reduces experimental time by skipping the cell growth steps associated with cloning, transformation, and protein production (Mart\u00ednez and Schwaneberg, 2013). Single-cell encapsulation https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00103 Cells are the most straightforward way of protein production, yet they often lack the ability to take up the desired screening substrate or to retain the nascent product. They can be co-encapsulated with all compounds required for the screening reaction (substrates, cell lysis agents, buffer etc.) in an emulsion droplet and the enzyme of interest can be released from the cell in situ. This is an elegant approach, as it combines the advantages of cells and emulsion compartments: that is, the cells produce the enzyme; the emulsion retains the genotype\u2013 phenotype connection. Although high-throughput sorting rates are feasible with emulsions in a conventional flow cytometer or in custom-made chip devices, the restriction of compartmentalizing a maximum of one cell per emulsion droplet by Poisson\u2019s distribution causes most of the droplets to be empty. Therefore, the effective throughput is reduced. Nevertheless, from a sustainability point of view, microcompartments are superior to conventional assays, since only pico- or even femtoliters of reagents are used per sample as previously discussed by Agresti et al. Moreover, the compartmentalization of a single cell in such a small reaction volume typically results in high local enzyme concentrations during screening, which benefits the signal-to noise ratio. As previously discussed in the Fluorescent protein-based methods section, the stochastic nature of gene expression - phenotypic cell-to-cell variability - (Elowitz, 2002) can make FACS screenings misleading in some cases (Schaerli and Isalan, 2013). Imagine that due to noise, a single genotype (promoter sequence or synthetic circuit) can produce different fluorescence levels within the population. In this case, many cells will be sorted into different bins although having the same genotype. One way to tackle this problem is to use statistical methods after the sequencing step to find in which bin a single genotype is enriched (although it might be present in other bins). A second approach would be to select genotypes with high stochasticity, re-clone them and analyse the populational behaviour in both flow cytometry and plate reader. Lastly, an alternative method that has been gaining attention in recent years, is based on the gel encapsulation of microcolonies. With this technology, it is possible to use the high-throughput power of FACS for screening cell populations and circumventing the problem of high cell-to-cell variability (Weaver et al., 1991; Sahar et al., 1994; Zengler et al., 2002; Fischlechner et al., 2014; Meyer et al., 2015; Duarte et al., 2017).

FADS cytometers, on the other hand, can generate droplets that will encapsulate cell-free mixtures or cells for subsequent analysis and sorting. Despite their differences, both systems are used for high-throughput screening of particles and we will mostly focus on FACS applications as they are more common/accessible among laboratories. FACS cytometers are complex instruments that can analyze the fluorescent characteristics of individual \u201cparticles\u201d (e.g., cells, liposomes, beads, emulsion droplets, or polymer shells) at extremely high event rates (~10^7 per hour), isolating those with the desired signal for the desired trait","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"resources/FACS_FADS/#challenges","text":"The main bottleneck in the usage of these systems is that they require the linkage of a genotype (a nucleic acid sequence) to a phenotype (a functional feature like binding or catalytic activity) in an ultrahigh-throughput context (Griffiths and Tawfik, 2006). In other words, the activity of an evolved molecule must be somehow linked to an output that is detectable by the FACS machine (usually a fluorescence signal). Once detected, the particle is sorted and its content can then be sequenced for establishing the genotype-phenotype relationship. Creating experimental setups for these types of studies can be very difficult depending on the system one is working with. If you work with the directed evolution of fluorescent proteins, the signal is directly provided by your protein, however, if you work with metabolic enzymes, for example, you might have to use indirect methods, such as fluorogenic substrates (if available), transcription factors that detect the product of your reaction, being induced by it, and activate the expression of a fluorescent protein, etc. Thus, for screenings involving indirect relationships, things can get a way more complicated. We will see below many examples addressing these challenges and, hopefully, they will serve as inspiration for your project!

Later, each bin is sequenced through and the pool of regulatory sequences in each bin is analysed for the understanding, prediction and re-engineering of sequence-function (promoter-expression) relationships, https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-016-2533-5 https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-genom-083118-014845 Although not exactly a directed evolution project, the work from de Boer and colleagues (de Boer et al., 2019) provides an insightful resource for the generation and study of promoter libraries in yeast. Through the usage of random mutagenesis, a library of 100,000,000 promoters was cloned upstream of a Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) gene and screened through FACS for different promoter activities (cells were binned according to their YFP expression levels). Each bin was then sequenced and a machine learning interpretable model was built with this data, allowing accurate prediction of the library and of independent test promoters that were designed de novo following the model rules. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0315-8 In a similar approach using E. coli cells, Urtecho and colleagues (Urtecho et al., 2019) explored the combinatorial space of sigma70 promoter elements in E. coli a combinatorial library of promoter elements was generated, cloned upstream a GFP reporter gene, sorted into bins by FACS and sequenced (both DNA and RNA-seq) for establishing the genotype (promoter sequence)-phenotype(GFP expression bins) relationships. One could use this strategy to evolve not only constitutive promoters but also inducible promoters (see see Rohlihil et al., 2017 for the Engineering a Formaldehyde-Inducible Promoter and Yu et al., 2021 for the engineering of LacI based systems) towards different expression dynamics. https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.biochem.7b01069 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20094-3 https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00114 Directed evolution of enzymes by linking the product to a biosensor Although linking enzyme mutant libraries to FPs for FACS-based directed evolution is not a straightforward task, many groups have achieved it through the adoption of in vivo Biosensors. These biosensors can be any molecular sensor (usually protein or RNA-based one) that will interact with the product of a specific reaction and modulate the expression of a FP according to the product concentration. The biggest challenge is to find/engingineer sensors that can detect specific metabolites (in the native cellular concentrations) and also possess a good dynamic range for reliably connecting the input (product concentration) to the output (FP production). A comprehensive review in this topic has been written by Lin and colleagues and will probably give you some inspiring ideas if you decide to work on this topic. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0734975017300812 As an example of using a transcription factor to link the activity of an enzyme to the expression of a FP, let's consider the work of Kwon and collaborators (Kwon et al., 2018). In this study, the main goal was to change the substrate scope of a tryptophan-indole lyase from tryptophan-indole to tyrosine-phenol. The expression of the FP in E. coli cells was controlled by a phenol-inducible transcription factor (DmpR). Using this genetic circuit-based biosensor for detection of phenolic components, the substrate scope of a tryptophan-indole lyase was re-engineered by directed evolution towards the desired tyrosine-phenol-lyase with complete loss of the original activity. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20943-8 RNA sensors have also been used to screen enzymes from directed evolution with improved activities. For example, Michener and Smolke (Michener and Smolke, 2012) have targeted yCDM1, an enzyme that is not very efficient in demethylating caffeine to theophylline. A RNA riboswitch was used as a theophylline biosensor. The RNA switch was placed in the 3\u2032 UTR region of a fluorescent reporter gene. If no theophylline was available, the poly-A tail of the mRNA was removed, leading to rapid degradation and low gene expression. Addition of the small molecule ligand favored a conformation in which the mRNA was stable and translation could proceed. Thus, the enzyme was mutagenized through EP-PCR and the RNA-based biosensor was used for screening with FACS. A mutant version of yCDM1 was obtained showing 33-fold increase in enzyme activity and 22-fold increase in selectivity. (Michener and Smolke, 2012). https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S109671761200047X?via%3Dihub Directed evolution of RNA/DNA aptamers/switches If a biosensor for your system is not available, why not try to develop one through directed evolution? This strategy, although very laborious, has been adopted by many groups with a special focus on RNA-based sensors. The first class of RNA-based sensors we will see are Riboswitches. They are biosensors typically composed of an aptamer domain, which recognizes a specific ligand, and an expression platform that couples ligand binding to a change in the FP expression. A traditional example of riboswitch directed evolution was demonstrated by Sean and Gallivan (Sean & Gallivan, 2009). Libraries (theophylline aptamer, followed by a sequence of eight randomized bases, the RBS, and the red-fluorescent reporter gene DsRed) were generated through random primers and cloned into plasmids for in vivo expression in E. coli. The system was coupled to a FP in a way that FP expression was increased in the presence of theophylline through the exposure of the RBS region, which was previously \u201cmasked\u201d by the mRNA secondary structure. A more recent study by Page and colleagues (Page et al., 2018) using the same system has also generated novel theophylline riboswitches by coupling a dual genetic selection and FACS. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2615613/ https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00099 The second class of RNA-based sensors are toehold switches, A toehold switch is an RNA fragment with a secondary hairpin structure that is used to regulate translation. The toehold sequence contains a strong ribosome binding site (RBS) and a start codon that is followed by the coding sequence of a reporter gene. In the absence of a complementary sequence, the toehold is in its native hairpin conformation acting as a translational repressor and preventing ribosomes from binding to the RBS and thus from translating the reporter gene downstream. In the presence of a single stranded trigger complementary to the stem of the hairpin, the switch unfolds and exposes the ribosome binding site and the start codon and translation can be initiated. In a very comprehensive study, Green and colleagues (Green et al., 2014) have designed and characterized libraries of Toehold Switches, ending up with 26 sensors that could be used together with very little crosstalk and high dynamic range for the detection of endogenous mRNA in E. coli and the building of genetic circuits. The researchers used the NUPACK nucleic acid sequence design package (Zadeh et al., 2011) to generate libraries of de-novo-designed translational activators satisfying their desired parameters followed by synthesis of the oligos, cloning and in vivo testing of the libraries through FACS. In a more recent study,Angenent-Mari and colleagues ( Angenent-Mari et al., 2020) have taken one step further, using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to predict toehold switch function as a canonical riboswitch model in synthetic biology. To facilitate DNN training, they synthesized and characterized in vivo a dataset of 91,534 toehold switches spanning 23 viral genomes and 906 human transcription factors. DNNs trained on nucleotide sequences outperformed previous state-of-the-art thermodynamic and kinetic models. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867414012896 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18677-1","title":"Fluorescent protein-based methods"},{"location":"resources/FACS_FADS/#entrapment-of-the-substrateproduct-inside-the-cells","text":"An alternative to cell surface dis\u00adplay strategies and FP-based screening methods are approaches in which the fluorescent product is trapped within the cell (Yang and Withers, 2009). This strategy faces two main challenges: (i) the obtention of commercial fluorogenic substrates for that specific reaction and (ii) the retention of such molecules inside of the cell. In this context, before starting a project based on this approach, one has to check for the availability of commercial fluorogenic substrates that cannot diffuse to the extracellular environment. The entrapment is usually achieved when the size, polarity, or other chemical proper\u00adties of the substrate are modified, resulting in the retention of the product within the cell. As a successful example, Tan and colleagues (Tan et al., 2019) have improved the fucosylation catalytic efficiency of an \u03b11,3-FucT fucosidase by 14-fold after three rounds of directed evolution in E. coli. Two kinds of fluorescently labeled acceptor substrates (LacNAc derivatives) were designed and synthesized for cell entrapment. They were transported into the cell via the LacY transporter. The fucosylation reaction resulted in a trisaccharide product that accumulated inside of the cell as the LacY transport rate for such products was very low. Thus, fluorescence intensities of cells carried the information about the fucosylation efficiency allowing FACS-based screenings. Another possibility is to work with fluorogenic probes inside the cell that detect the substrate/product of the reaction. Sadler and colleagues (Sadler et al., 2018) have engineered a monoamine oxidase with improved activity towards a novel secondary amine substrate amine substrates based on the intracellular oxidation of a fluorogenic substrate by intracellular bacterial peroxidases. The authors expressed the amine oxidase variant library in E. coli and stained cells with a fluorogenic probe which is sensitive to oxidation by H2O2 (a byproduct of the monoamine oxidase reaction). The probe was introduced into cells with the help of freeze-thaw cycles and chemicals that increased membrane permeability. Finally, the drawback of substrate/product entrapment in the cell can also be overcome by the adoption of cell microencapsulation techniques that imitate natural cell compartmentalization as previously discussed in the Cell surface display section. As an example, a microdroplet-enabled FACS based screening strategy was also developed for improving cellulase activity. In this study, Ostafe et al. used double emulsions to encapsulate yeast cells expressing cellulase in microfluidic droplets (Ostafe et al., 2013). Glucose that was released by cellulose activity on carboxymethylcellulose substrate was detected via a hexose oxidase based coupled enzyme assay and enrichment of a positive population was demonstrated based on droplet fluorescence. https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/10/eaaw8451 https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/AN/C8AN00851E#!divAbstract","title":"Entrapment of the substrate/product inside the cells"},{"location":"resources/FACS_FADS/#in-vitro-compartmentalization-ivc","text":"Microencapsulation can be performed in the absence of cells, directly producing the enzyme from the DNA library by in vitro protein translation.

Additionally, IVC prevents the gene diversity loss derived from the cloning and transformation steps by in vitro protein translation of the DNA used to generate the mutant library; moreover, it reduces experimental time by skipping the cell growth steps associated with cloning, transformation, and protein production (Mart\u00ednez and Schwaneberg, 2013).","title":"In vitro compartmentalization (IVC)"},{"location":"resources/FACS_FADS/#single-cell-encapsulation","text":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00103 Cells are the most straightforward way of protein production, yet they often lack the ability to take up the desired screening substrate or to retain the nascent product. They can be co-encapsulated with all compounds required for the screening reaction (substrates, cell lysis agents, buffer etc.) in an emulsion droplet and the enzyme of interest can be released from the cell in situ. This is an elegant approach, as it combines the advantages of cells and emulsion compartments: that is, the cells produce the enzyme; the emulsion retains the genotype\u2013 phenotype connection. Although high-throughput sorting rates are feasible with emulsions in a conventional flow cytometer or in custom-made chip devices, the restriction of compartmentalizing a maximum of one cell per emulsion droplet by Poisson\u2019s distribution causes most of the droplets to be empty. Therefore, the effective throughput is reduced. Nevertheless, from a sustainability point of view, microcompartments are superior to conventional assays, since only pico- or even femtoliters of reagents are used per sample as previously discussed by Agresti et al. Moreover, the compartmentalization of a single cell in such a small reaction volume typically results in high local enzyme concentrations during screening, which benefits the signal-to noise ratio. As previously discussed in the Fluorescent protein-based methods section, the stochastic nature of gene expression - phenotypic cell-to-cell variability - (Elowitz, 2002) can make FACS screenings misleading in some cases (Schaerli and Isalan, 2013). Imagine that due to noise, a single genotype (promoter sequence or synthetic circuit) can produce different fluorescence levels within the population. In this case, many cells will be sorted into different bins although having the same genotype. One way to tackle this problem is to use statistical methods after the sequencing step to find in which bin a single genotype is enriched (although it might be present in other bins). A second approach would be to select genotypes with high stochasticity, re-clone them and analyse the populational behaviour in both flow cytometry and plate reader. Lastly, an alternative method that has been gaining attention in recent years, is based on the gel encapsulation of microcolonies. With this technology, it is possible to use the high-throughput power of FACS for screening cell populations and circumventing the problem of high cell-to-cell variability (Weaver et al., 1991; Sahar et al., 1994; Zengler et al., 2002; Fischlechner et al., 2014; Meyer et al., 2015; Duarte et al., 2017).","title":"Single-cell encapsulation"},{"location":"resources/FACS_FADS/#protocol-and-application","text":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6047729/pdf/emss-78570.pdf https://sci-hub.se/https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00111","title":"Protocol and application:"},{"location":"resources/FACS_FADS/#review","text":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-666X/10/11/734/htm","title":"Review:"},{"location":"resources/PACE_PANCE/","text":"Phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) and Phage-assisted noncontinuous evolution (PANCE) Introduction Phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) and its continuous variant, developed by Esvelt et al. 2011. This method offers the possibility to continuously mutate and select proteins with the help of M13 bacteriophages. Effectively, within the PACE process M13 is allowed to propagate whenever the gene of interest (GOI), which is incorporated into the phage genome, is active. PACE is one of a few directed evolution methods which are continuous. Non-continuous evolution methods usually start with the diversification of the target, then functional mutants from the library are selected. These functional mutants can then be used as a basis for the next round of diversification to improve their properties. Continuous evolution methods enable an uninterrupted diversification and selection of the target and thus promise faster results. For PACE more than 100 rounds of selection can be performed within 2 weeks (Miller et al. 2020). So why don\u2019t we use continuous evolution methods all the time? Continuous evolution methods are usually very complex to set-up. The crucial condition to make continuous evolution work is to apply selection pressure onto the GOI and not to the host organism. Some methods do so by introducing targeted mutagenesis methods (e.g. EvolvR (Halperin et al. 2018) or error-prone DNA-polymerases (Camps et al. 2013) or T7 RNA-polymerase systems (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0331-8)). In PACE, the target gene is encoded by an M13 phage and the selection pressure is applied to Escherichia coli cells (Badran et al. 2015). So how does PACE work? For PACE M13 bacteriophages are used, the same are used in Phage Display(link). M13 phages infect E. coli and establish a \u2018chronic infection\u2019 with an average generation time around 15 min (Barbas et al. 2001). The phage consists of a single-strand DNA genome encapsulated by five coat proteins. The coat protein relevant for PACE is pIII, which is essential for phage infectivity. The basic principle of PACE is to replace the CDS of the pIII coat proteins by the CDS of the target gene which shall be evolved. The pIII gene is located on an accessory plasmid and its expression is activated in response to the activity of the protein of interest. Thus the only phage that bears a functioning protein of interest is allowed to propagate in the culture. Furthermore, the E. coli cells carry a mutagenesis plasmid which enables ongoing mutation of the selection phage. Through this set-up, two possible scenarios can happen when the selection phage infects a cell: The selection phage already carries a functional target gene or the mutation plasmid causes mutations which are beneficial for target functionality resulting in the target gene enabling pIII expression and infectious phages are produced and assembled, which can then infect other cells The selection phage carries a non-functional target gene or the mutation plasmid introduces mutations which inhibit the target functionality resulting in the target gene not enabling pIII expression and no infectious phages are produced In theory, PACE does not represent a method for targeted mutation since usually whole-genome mutators are used. However, due to the fast replication rate of the phages, the phages have a higher mutation rate and even if a selection plasmid is mutated and \u201cwrong\u201d phages are produced, these will be selected in the cells they infect next. PACE is usually performed in a continuous cultivation set-up. In this set-up, the E. coli host cells are cultivated as a fed-batch cultivation and these host cells are used as feed for the actual cultivation where the evolution happens \u2013 the lagoon. In the lagoon, the phages are able to replicate under a continuous feed of the host cells and a continuous outflow of waste (phages and cells). To better understand the basic principle, we will take a look at an example project using PACE: The evolution of a T7-RNA polymerase to recognize another promoter described by Esvelt et al. 2011. To evolve the polymerase, the CDS of pIII was replaced by the CDS of the T7-polymerase. The plasmid responsible for the selection pressure carried the CDS of pIII downstream of a T3/T7 hybrid promoter. The selection phages are replicated using a strain that can express pIII, producing functional phages with genomes encoding the T7-RNA polymerase CDS. These phages can then infect the cells carrying the plasmid with pIII under the control of the T3/T7 hybrid promoter. If the mutation plasmid introduces mutations that enable the polymerase to recognize the new promoter, pIII is expressed and functional phages are assembled. These phages can then infect new host cells and will be mutated and selected again. Next to the T7-RNA polymerase, directed evolution using PACE has been used to evolve for example TALE array proteins (Hubbard et al. 2015), Cas9 variants (Hu et al. 2018; Miller et al. 2020), protein-protein interactions using a two-hybrid system (Badran et al. 2016), tRNA/aminoacyl-synthetases (Bryson et al. 2017), and base-editors (Thuronyi et al. 2019). So what are the requirements and challenges using PACE to evolve your protein of choice? A very detailed protocol about requirements, how to set-up, and troubleshoot PACE (and PANCE) experiments is published by Miller et al. 2020. In short: The crucial condition to use PACE is that the functionality of the target protein needs to be linkable to pIII expression. Furthermore, the start of the directed evolution process can pose a challenge. When the target protein has little or no activity, even after mutation by the selection plasmid, the phages can be washed out of the continuous system. In this case, an adaption of the selection pressure or a switch to phage-assisted non-continuous evolution (PANCE) are possible choices. PANCE, in general, is probably the easier method when getting started with phage-assisted evolution, since it avoids the set-up of the continuous cultivation set-up. References Badran, A.

Two idea was behind its development: to avoid relying on prone for degradation mRNA in the selection process and to keep high level of genetic diversity similar to the mRNA and Ribosome displays (1013). Other DNA-based in vitro selection methods are largely based on encapsulation of DNA into vesicles which needs to be clonal and therefore genetic libraries get severy dilluted with maximum coverage 109 mutants. The CIS display reportedly allows recovery of a specific binder from a pool of non-binding mutants present at a ratio of 1 in 1010! Principle of CIS display In the CIS display a linear dsDNA served as a template. It usually has a promoter, a single open reading frame encoding target library and following it in frame repA gene (that binds specifically to dsDNA). The template also has cis and ori sequences the RepA protein associates with. The dsDNA template is then added to E. coli transcription-translation mixture (it could also be mixtures from other organisms). The RNA polymerase will produce mRNA from the template dsDNA and paused on CIS element. This is followed by the ribosome initiating translation on this mRNA-dsDNA complex. Newly translated (library peptide)-RepA fusion transiently associates with the CIS element on DNA template which eventually leads to RepA tightly binding adjacent ori sequence.

Obtained DNA-protein pool is incubated with an immobilized on a magnetic bead bait and nonbinding peptides got washed away while retained ones get eluted, PCR-amplified and usually use in the next round of selection. Challenges Apart from all the challenges that are normally associated with setting up an in vitro transcription-translation system, the CIS-display specifically is limited to the proteins that are (1) small and (2) well-fodlabe such that their function is not affected by the N-terminally fused RepA protein.

In recent years, different computational methods have emerged that take advantage of the thousands of sequences and structures deposited in gene and protein databases. Comprehensive reviews of these computational tools have been recently published (Damborsky and Brezovsky, 2014; Sebestova et al., 2014, Sequeiros-Borja et al., 2020), so here we will simply mention a few representative examples of the most common computational algorithms used to date. https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bib/bbaa150/5879227?login=true SCHEMA: This computational method allows libraries to be designed by recombination of several homologous sequences (with as little as 55 % identity) while maximizing the number of folded proteins (Voigt et al., 2002). SCHEMA predicts the fragments that must be inherited in the same parent, thereby allowing the computational selection of blocks from which novel proteins (chimeras) can be assembled. The selection of crossover locations is based on a metric for disruption, defined as the number of interactions of a hybrid protein that are broken when a given pattern of fragments is inherited from each of the parents (ie, the pairs of residues within 4.5 \u00c5 of each other that are not present as the same pair in any of the parents\u2014defined as SCHEMA energy). This method requires a multiple sequence alignment of the parental sequences, a PDB file, and a UNIX-based computer.

MAP is used to predict the quality of the mutant library based on the epPCR method chosen and the nucleotide composition of the target gene. It works at three levels of information using three distinct indicators: (1) the protein structure indicator provides data about the likelihood of introducing stop codons and residues that destabilize the helical structure (Pro, Gly), (2) the amino acid diversity indicator shows the proportion of variants with preserved amino acids (ie, amino acids that do not change with a single nucleotide substitution\u2014silent mutations\u2014) and the average number of amino acid substitutions after a single nucleotide change, and (3) the chemical diversity indicator provides the chemical diversity generated in terms of amino acid substitution (aliphatic, aromatic, neutral, charged). The new version of the server (MAP2.0 3D) permits further mapping of the sequence indicators onto the target protein\u2019s 3D structure, correlating the pattern of amino acid substitution with structural information regarding local interactions solvent accessibility, residual motility, and secondary elements. To work, MAP2.0 3D requires only the target gene sequence and a PDB file (or a homology model) of the protein.

For each individual amino acid, the tool gives information about the degree of mutability (and possible amino acid substitution at that position), functional and structural significance, and similar residues in related enzymes. The server integrates data from several bioinformatics databases allowing structural and evolutionary previews to be performed. The requirements to run HotSpot Wizard are minimal, only the PDB file of the target protein.

By superimposing protein family structures from different sources (including mutations reported in the literature), a structure sequence alignment provides valuable information about conserved residues and more mutable amino acids to create CSM libraries. Link: https://www.bio-prodict.com/ ProSAR (Protein Sequence Activity Relationship): This computational platform unmasks beneficial mutations from experimental mutant libraries (even from mutants with reduced function) to be incorporated into new iterative rounds of directed evolution. ProSAR follows the same principles that rule QSAR (an algorithm used for drug design) but applied to protein engineering to sort out beneficial, neutral, and detrimental mutations from a given mutant library in order to find new epistatic effects within a given protein scaffold (Fox et al., 2007). ROSETTA: The Rosetta software suite for macromolecular modeling, docking, and design is widely used in pharmaceutical, industrial, academic, non-profit, and government laboratories. Considering its broad modeling capabilities, Rosetta consistently ranks highly when compared to other leading methods created for highly specialized protein modeling and design tasks. Developed for over two decades by a global community of scientists at more than 60 institutions, Rosetta has undergone multiple refactorings, and now comprises over three million lines of code. Among its many uses, the most common applications are: Predicting protein structures; modeling protein\u2013protein and DNA/RNA-protein complexes; design/modeling antibodies and other immune system proteins; designing new proteins and functions. A limitation of Rosetta is the need for a local installation and compilation in a Unix-like environment. Webservers provide a user-friendly alternative and a number of independent servers have emerged in our community. However, implementing and maintaining such servers comes at a substantial cost. To make it easier to provide protocols webservers, ROSIE (Rosetta Online Server that Includes Everyone) (http://rosie.rosettacommons.org/) implements a simple framework for \u201cserverification\u201d of protocols.

By building models directly from data, machine learning has proven to be a powerful, efficient, and versatile tool for a variety of applications, such as extracting abstract concepts from text and images or beating humans at our most complex games (11, 12). Previous applications of machine learning in protein engineering have identified beneficial mutations (13) and optimal combinations of protein fragments (14) for increased enzyme activity and protein stability, as reviewed recently (15). Example/Application: Here we use machine learning to enhance directed evolution by using combinatorial libraries of mutations to explore sequence space more efficiently than conventional directed evolution with single mutation walks. The size of a mutant library grows exponentially with the number of residues considered for mutation and quickly becomes intractable for experimental screening. However, by leveraging in silico models built based on sampling of a combinatorial library, machine learning assists directed evolution to make multiple mutations simultaneously and traverse fitness landscapes more efficiently. In the machine learning-assisted directed evolution strategy presented here, multiple amino acid residues are randomized in each generation. Sequence\u2013function information sampled from the large combinatorial library is then used to predict a restricted library with an increased probability of containing variants with high fitness. The best-performing variants from the predicted libraries are chosen as the starting points for the next round of evolution, from which further improved variants are identified. https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/18/8852.full.pdf A good and concise example of combining computational and experimental approaches: In our last example, a good combination of dry and wetlab was employed. The IPTG responsive Transcription Factor LacI has been computationally redesigned and mutated to recognize four new non-native inducers (Taylor et al., 2016). This study is a good example of how the combination of computation-guided mutagenesis based on the Rosetta algorithm and different diversification techniques (such as epPCR and saturation mutagenesis) can accelerate the discovery/generation of new molecular functions. In a counter-selection round, the mutant libraries were pre-screened for retained ability to repress a TolC reporter (a porin that allows entry of toxic colicin E1) by growth enrichment in the absence of inducers but in the presence of colicin E1. The enriched LacI libraries were then positively screened by FACS for their ability to activate production of GFP upon induction with different sugars, resulting in variants of LacI that were responsive to fucose, gentiobiose, lactitol and sucralose (Taylor et al., 2016). In this instance, no active counter-screening was performed against activation by IPTG, so nearly all mutants retained their ability to respond to IPTG, a phenotype that was reduced for some designs upon shuffling of mutations for activity screening. https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/1/e3/5645005?login=true Reviews Computational tools for enzyme improvement: why everyone can \u2013 and should \u2013 use them https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593117300248 Computational Tools for Designing Smart Libraries https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-1053-3_20 Protein computational design - recent review https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975021000021 From directed evolution to computational enzyme engineering\u2014A review https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aic.16847 Other examples: CADEE: Computer-Aided Directed Evolution of Enzymes https://journals.iucr.org/m/issues/2017/01/00/be5274/index.html Machine learning-assisted directed protein evolution with combinatorial libraries https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/18/8852.full.pdf Principles of Machine Learning Guided Protein Engineering https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37365914 Discovery of Novel Gain-of-Function Mutations Guided by Structure-Based Deep Learning https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00345 Deep Dive into Machine Learning Models for Protein Engineering https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00073 Underrated Machine Learning Papers for Protein Design https://medium.com/proteinqure/underrated-machine-learning-papers-for-protein-design-applications-a846e294330 Deep Learning in Protein Structural Modeling and Design https://www.cell.com/patterns/pdf/S2666-3899(20)30190-2.pdf","title":"Computational tools"},{"location":"resources/computational_tools/#computational-tools-for-library-creation-design-and-analysis","text":"Combining computational algorithms with directed evolution allows experimental methods such as Combinatorial Saturation Mutagenesis, DNA recombination and epPCR to be performed in a more effective way, leading to biocatalysts with strong biotechnological potential while reducing the demands on screening.

The method most often used to generate variants with random mutations is error-prone PCR (epPCR). Here we present the basic protocols and tips for using epPCR to generate gene variants that exhibit a relatively balanced spectrum of mutations and for capturing as much diversity as possible through effective cloning of those variants. The principles of epPCR Error-prone PCR protocols are modifications of standard PCR methods, designed to alter and enhance the natural error rate of the polymerase. There are many ways to control the mutation rate of epPCR. EpPCR reactions typically contain higher concentrations of MgCl2 (7 mM) compared to basic PCR reactions (1.5 mM), in order to stabilize non-complementary pairs.(Ling et al., 1991) MnCl2 can also be added to increase the error-rate.(Lin-Goerke, Robbins & Burczak, 1997) Other ways of modifying mutation rate include varying the ratios of nucleotides in the reaction or including a nucleotide analog such as 8-oxo-dGTP or dITP. Mutation frequencies from 0.11 to 2% (1 to 20 nucleotides per 1 kb) have been achieved simply by varying the nucleotide ratio and the amount of MnCl2 in the PCR reaction.(Fromant, Blanquet & Plateau, 1995) The number of genes that contain a mutation can also be modified by changing the number of effective doublings by increasing/decreasing the number of cycles or by changing the initial template concentration. An expression system and high-throughput assay should be developed before a library of enzyme variants are generated. epPCR provides access to an almost unlimited number of variants, but generally have a lower hit rate and are therefore better suited to high throughput screening or selection strategies. To take full advantage of the power of error-prone PCR, the assay must be accurate enough to detect small improvements and sensitive enough to detect the low levels of activity typically encountered in the beginning rounds of an evolution experiment.

To achieve this, mutated copies of a protein-coding sequence are fragmented with DNase I or restriction enzyme and the fragments are then reassembled in a PCR without primers. In Vitro Homologous Recombination DNA shuffling was the first reported method of in vitro recombination. DNAse I is first used to randomly fragment the parental genes. Then, provided there is sufficient sequence similarity between overlapping regions of DNA fragments from different parents, the fragments can anneal to one another and reassemble into a full-length gene using a primer-less PCR. Depending on the total gene size, the degree of sequence similarity between parental DNA strands, and desired number of crossovers, fragment sizes after DNAse I treatment can vary from as low as 10\u201350 bp to greater than 1 kb. Random point mutations tend to occur at low rates during recombination even with a high-fidelity polymerase, and researchers will often intentionally employ error-prone PCR during PCR-based gene recombination to further diversify their library. DNA shuffling can aslso be done on a set of naturally occuring homologous genes, instead of generted by epPCR a set of mutant genes. This technique is called \u201cfamily shuffling\u201d. A number of other PCR-based and homology-dependent protocols have since been developed which accomplish essentially the same as DNA shuffling.

The rationale behind developing these two types of displays was to (1) eliminate the reliance on the formation of stalled ribosome complex which is unstable and prone to dissociation and (2), mRNA has known stability issues itself, hence the goal was to reverse transcribe it before performing the subsequent selection, respectively. These methods are typically used for finding protein-, peptide- or peptidomimetic binders. The main advantage of this method is library size that can theoretically reach 1015 mutants. This roughly corresponds to 12 randomised positions in a peptide. Additionally, performing selection in vitro gives control over a wide range of experimental conditions including the use of exotic chemistries (for the search of enzymes) and non-proteogenic modified amino acids in case of peptidomimetic selection. Principle of the mRNA and cDNA displays As opposed to the Ribosome display, where mRNA and the nascent chain (= protein or peptide) are physically connected via a stalled ribosome, in the mRNA display, a nascent chain gets attached covalently to its mRNA via the antibiotic puromycin, that is coupled to it. Puromycin resembles 3\u2019-end of tyrosyl-tRNA. Specifically, it contains para-methyl-tyrosine linked via a stable amide bond to 3\u2019-amino group of the modified adenosine. Normally, its incorporation into the growing protein chain leads to the termination of protein synthesis. In the late 90s, the group of Jack Szostak (https://www.pnas.org/content/94/23/12297.long) realised that puromycin can be linked to an oligonucleotide which, in turn, can also be ligated to mRNA.

The rationale behind developing these two types of displays was to (1) eliminate the reliance on the formation of stalled ribosome complex which is unstable and prone to dissociation and (2), mRNA has known stability issues itself, hence the goal was to reverse transcribe it before performing the subsequent selection, respectively. These methods are typically used for finding protein-, peptide- or peptidomimetic binders. The main advantage of this method is library size that can theoretically reach 1015 mutants. This roughly corresponds to 12 randomised positions in a peptide.

Normally, its incorporation into the growing protein chain leads to the termination of protein synthesis. In the late 90s, the group of Jack Szostak (https://www.pnas.org/content/94/23/12297.long) realised that puromycin can be linked to an oligonucleotide which, in turn, can also be ligated to mRNA.

Phage display is a laboratory technique used for the high-throughput screening of protein- and peptide-binders. In this technique, a gene encoding a protein of interest (POI) is expressed in frame (i.e. as a fusion) with the phage coat protein gene, causing the phage to \"display\" the protein on its outside. The phage itself serves as a 'vessel' connecting the displayed phenotype and genotype. The displaying phages can then be screened against various bait molecules (proteins, peptides or DNA sequences) for specific interaction with them. In this way, large libraries of proteins can be screened and amplified in a process called in vitro selection. The most common bacteriophages used in phage display are M13 and FD filamentous phage, though T4, T7, and \u03bb phage are also used. General principle. In the M13 phage display, the DNA encoding POI is expressed N-terminally with either pIII or pVIII gene, which encodes the minor and major coat proteins. The pIII gene is responsible for binding to E.coli via associating with the F' pilus thereby triggering infection. Certain E.coli strains are suitable for this purpose: TG1, SS320, ER2738, or XL1-Blue. Fusing POI to the pIII N-terminus ensures correct exposure of a target peptide for the interaction with a bait molecule. The POIs of sizes less than 50 amino acids largely don't affect the main function of the coat protein - phage infectivity. For larger POIs a \"phagemid\" vector is used (a simplified display construct vector) that encodes a fused version of the coat-protein with the intact coat protein (and other phage lifecyle-components) provided by a helper phage. Upon infection, intact pIII competes with POI-pIII fusion resulting in a large portion of the phage population not displaying POI and a small portion that would contain on average a single copy of POI-pIII per phage particle. Use of phagemid is beneficial in two ways: ( 1 ) smaller vector enables higher transformation efficiency hence higher genetic diversity libraries; ( 2 ) use of monovalent display of POI on phages often results in selection of higher affinity binders due to the absence of an 'avidity' effect. The bait molecules are typically immobilised on the surface of a microtiter plate. Phages that tightly interact with the bait will remain attached to the plate while the majority of the phage population will be washed away. The remaining phage are then eluted and amplified again in the next round of bacterial infection resulting in a phage mixture enriched with phages that bind the target molecule. This process is referred to as panning is typically repeated a number of times to establish high level of enrichment of phages encoding tight-binder POIs. Phage eluted in the final step can then be used to infect a suitable bacterial host, from which the phagemids are collected and subsequently analysed by NGS or Sanger sequencing coupled with ELISA. The use of a helper phage can be eliminated by using 'bacterial packaging cell line' technology 1 . Elution is usually carried out by using trypsin to digest the bait protein and presented binding protein, thus releasing the bound phage, or by using low pH buffer to dissociate electrostatic interactions. Competitive elution can also be used if a known binder is available and binder for a specific region (e.g. a catalytic pocket) is desired. General protocol. A common protocol for the phage display would consist of the following steps: 1. Bait protein or DNA molecules are immobilized to the wells of a microtiter plate either chemically or via biotin:streptavidin interaction. 2. GOI sequences are expressed in the bacteriophage library as a fusion with a bacteriophage coat protein. 3. This phage-display library is added to the dish and after allowing the phage time to bind, the dish is washed. 4. Phage-displaying proteins that interact with the target molecules remain attached to the dish, while all others are washed away. 5. Attached phage may be eluted and used to create more phage by infection of suitable bacterial hosts. The new phage constitutes an enriched mixture, containing considerably less irrelevant phage (i.e. non-binding) than were present in the initial mixture. 6. Steps 3 to 5 are optionally repeated one or more times, further enriching the phage library for high-affinity binding phages. 7. Following further bacterial-based amplification, the DNA within the interacting phage is sequenced to identify the interacting proteins or protein fragments. Challenges and requirements Benefits. The protocols are very well described and the techniques have been used for a long time now. The availability of different commercial kits makes this technique easy to be performed by non-experts. Phage display is quick, with four rounds of selection and screening feasible within two weeks. Problems. Given the biology of the phages, fast-growing phages will be enriched and peptides that are not relevant for the binding isolated. Also non-specific binders are often enriched because of the affinity of certain peptide/protein variants to the plastic of the titer plates or other supports used during the panning. Level of complexity. This technique is relatively easy, especially if starting from commercial kits. However, it is more complex if beginning from a different starting point and if rounds of diversification are needed. Materials and resources are the ones used in standard molecular biology techniques and instruments. However, to harvest phages, ultracentrifugation may be required. A plate reader is useful for reading ELISA plates, and the materials for ELISA needed for characterizing the binding of selected peptides can be expensive. References and useful protocols The best protocol to start with is the one present in the manual of the commercially available NEB kit for phage display: These kits starts from random short peptide sequences, if the starting point is a non-random sequence then the target sequence should be cloned into M13 KE cloning phage following protocols also from NEB Most of the relevant protocols for immobilization of the targets on the different solid support are also available on the NEB webpage Chasteen L, Ayriss J, Pavlik P, Bradbury AR.

Since then it has been developed into a mature method with a wide range of its varieties which include in the most advanced in vivo-SELEX (https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/nucleic-acids/fulltext/S2162-2531(20)30151-7), and cell-SELEX (https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/nucleic-acids/fulltext/S2162-2531(20)30151-7). Similar to other in vitro approaches it allows screening of libraries up to 1015 members. It is mainly limited to the selection of nucleic acids aptamers - natural (RNA or DNA) or synthetic (Xenonucleic acids or XNAs). Principle A typical library would contain 1015 individual oligonucleotides each of which is composed of a random region (20\u201350 nt) flanked by two standard primer binding sites for subsequent reverse transcription (if needed) and PCR amplification. In the selection step, this pool is incubated with target molecules, which may be attached to the surface (chromatography sorbent or nitrocellulose filter). After incubation, the column is washed and those oligonucleotides that are retained get eluted. A target-bound pool is then amplified in (RT-)PCR and this new enriched library is used in the next round of selection. Ten or more selection rounds are performed and the final library is NGS-screened for enriched motifs. Ultimately, the most representative members in the final library are further characterised in terms of their binding to a bait molecule. Challenges and requirements There are main challenges to this method: The bait molecule is typically attached on the resin which introduces a steric hindrance and biases the selection Nuclease degradation is an issue in RNA and DNA especially for SELEX performed in vivo. Typically selection is performed out of the context in vitro, whereas obtained aptamers are often aimed at use in vivo. This issue has been lately addressed in multiple reports (https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/nucleic-acids/fulltext/S2162-2531(20)30151-7). Future directions Overall, SELEX is an umbrella term for a wide variety of methods. It is a good technique to introduce oneself into the in vitro selection world. In its simplest form, it requires only a minimal set of instruments and materials. More advanced versions of SELEX (e.g. in vivo) are obviously harder to implement, but developments in this field are highly important for the diagnostic and therapeutic use of aptamers and thus streamlining of these protocols is expected.","title":"SELEX"},{"location":"resources/selex/#introduction","text":"SELEX or Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment is the oldest technique among all-in vitro selection methods.

After incubation, the column is washed and those oligonucleotides that are retained get eluted. A target-bound pool is then amplified in (RT-)PCR and this new enriched library is used in the next round of selection. Ten or more selection rounds are performed and the final library is NGS-screened for enriched motifs. Ultimately, the most representative members in the final library are further characterised in terms of their binding to a bait molecule.","title":"Principle"},{"location":"resources/selex/#challenges-and-requirements","text":"There are main challenges to this method: The bait molecule is typically attached on the resin which introduces a steric hindrance and biases the selection Nuclease degradation is an issue in RNA and DNA especially for SELEX performed in vivo. Typically selection is performed out of the context in vitro, whereas obtained aptamers are often aimed at use in vivo. This issue has been lately addressed in multiple reports (https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/nucleic-acids/fulltext/S2162-2531(20)30151-7).","title":"Challenges and requirements"},{"location":"resources/selex/#future-directions","text":"Overall, SELEX is an umbrella term for a wide variety of methods. It is a good technique to introduce oneself into the in vitro selection world. In its simplest form, it requires only a minimal set of instruments and materials. More advanced versions of SELEX (e.g. in vivo) are obviously harder to implement, but developments in this field are highly important for the diagnostic and therapeutic use of aptamers and thus streamlining of these protocols is expected.","title":"Future directions"},{"location":"team_wiki/team_wiki_home/","text":"Team Wiki List of iDEC 2021 Wikis Instructions on setting up your team wikis","title":"Team Wiki"},{"location":"team_wiki/team_wiki_home/#team-wiki","text":"","title":"Team Wiki"},{"location":"team_wiki/team_wiki_home/#list-of-idec-2021-wikis","text":"","title":"List of iDEC 2021 Wikis"},{"location":"team_wiki/team_wiki_home/#instructions-on-setting-up-your-team-wikis","text":"","title":"Instructions on setting up your team wikis"}]}
